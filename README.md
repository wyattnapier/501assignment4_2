# Assignment 4-2

### Assignment Requirements

Create a reactive counter app called Counter++ that increments or decrements the count using buttons but also performs a background “auto-increment” operation every few seconds using a coroutine.

Requirements:
• Use ViewModel to manage the counter state.
• Implement StateFlow for unidirectional data flow.
• Add buttons for +1, -1, and Reset.
• Launch a coroutine that increments the counter every 3 seconds when “Auto” mode is toggled on.
• Display current count and status (“Auto mode: ON/OFF”).
• Add a settings screen to configure the auto-increment interval.
• Provide link to Git repo

### Result
Use the increment, decrement, and reset buttons to update the value of the counter on the main page. 
Hit the settings button to go to the settings page to toggle auto-incrementing and change the auto-incrementing step size.
